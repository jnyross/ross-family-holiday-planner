- State management approach
- UI library (Tailwind, shadcn/ui, MUI, etc.)

#### 2. Data Model (112 Destinations)

**Destinations Table:**
```typescript
interface Destination {
  id: string
  name: string
  country: string
  region: string // e.g., "Caribbean", "Mediterranean", "Southeast Asia"
  type: string // "Beach", "City", "Nature", "Cultural"

  // Logistics
  flight_hours: number // from UK
  time_difference: number // hours from GMT
  visa_required: string // "None", "Visa on arrival", "eVisa required"
  currency: string
  language: string
  budget_level: string // "Budget", "Mid-range", "Luxury"

  // Ratings (0-10)
  beach_pool_quality: number
  kid_facilities_quality: number
  high_star_share: number // 0-1 (percentage of 4-5 star hotels)

  // Planning
  best_months: string // "April-October"
  worst_months: string // "November-March"
  notes: string
}
```

**Climate Data Table:**
```typescript

}
```

#### 3. Scoring Algorithm (Research Required)

**Research Agents Should:**
- Agent 1: Research weather scoring algorithms (temperature ranges, rainfall thresholds)
- Agent 2: Study family travel ranking factors and weightings
- Agent 3: Analyze competitor scoring methodologies (TripAdvisor, Booking.com)

**Scoring Logic to Implement:**

```python
# Weather Score (30%) - Based on climate during holiday period
def calculate_weather_score(temp_avg, rainfall_mm):
    # Ideal: 24-30Â°C, <50mm rain
    # Research optimal temperature ranges for family beach holidays
    pass

# Flight Score (25%) - Inversely proportional to flight hours
def calculate_flight_score(flight_hours):
    # Max 15 hours, prefer <8 hours
    pass

# Beach Quality Score (15%)
def calculate_beach_score(beach_pool_quality):
    # 0-10 rating, scale to 0-100
    pass

# Kid Facilities Score (15%)
def calculate_kid_facilities_score(kid_facilities_quality):
    # 0-10 rating, scale to 0-100
    pass

# Luxury Score (15%)
def calculate_luxury_score(high_star_share):
    # Percentage of 4-5 star hotels
    pass
```

**Code Execution Task:**
Prototype the scoring algorithm with sample data and validate results.

| Community Support | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Consensus Decision: [Winner + Rationale]
```

### Phase 2: Data Generation (Use Code Execution)

**Step 1: Generate 112 Sample Destinations**

```python
# Use Code Execution to generate realistic sample data
import json
import random

regions = ["Caribbean", "Mediterranean", "Southeast Asia", "Middle East", "Indian Ocean"]
types = ["Beach", "City", "Nature", "Cultural"]

destinations = []
for i in range(112):
    dest = {
        "id": f"dest-{i+1}",
        "name": f"Destination {i+1}",  # Replace with real names
        "country": "...",
        "region": random.choice(regions),
        "type": random.choice(types),
        # ... generate other fields
    }
    destinations.append(dest)

# Generate climate data for each destination (12 months)
climate_data = []
for dest in destinations:
    for month in range(1, 13):
        climate_data.append({
            "destination_id": dest["id"],
            "month": month,
            "temperature_celsius": random.randint(15, 35),
            "rainfall_mm": random.randint(10, 200)
        })

print(json.dumps(destinations, indent=2))
```

**Step 2: Generate 8 UK Holiday Periods**

```python
# Generate 8 UK school holiday periods for 2025-2026
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

periods = [
    ("October Half Term 2025", "2025-10-27", "2025-11-03"),
    ("Christmas 2025", "2025-12-22", "2026-01-05"),
    ("February Half Term 2026", "2026-02-16", "2026-02-23"),
    ("Easter 2026", "2026-03-30", "2026-04-13"),
    ("May Half Term 2026", "2026-05-25", "2026-06-01"),
    ("Summer 2026", "2026-07-20", "2026-08-31"),
    ("October Half Term 2026", "2026-10-26", "2026-11-02"),
    ("Christmas 2026", "2026-12-21", "2027-01-04")
]

holiday_periods = []
for name, start, end in periods:
    start_date = datetime.strptime(start, "%Y-%m-%d")
    end_date = datetime.strptime(end, "%Y-%m-%d")
    duration = (end_date - start_date).days

    holiday_periods.append({
        "name": name,
        "start_date": start,
        "end_date": end,
        "duration_days": duration,
        "year": start_date.year,
        "term": name.split(" ")[0]  # "October", "Christmas", etc.
    })

print(json.dumps(holiday_periods, indent=2))
```

**Step 3: Calculate Scores (Validate Algorithm)**

```python
# Implement and validate scoring algorithm
def calculate_scores(destination, holiday_period, climate_data):
    # Get climate data for the holiday period months
    # Calculate weather score
    # Calculate other component scores
    # Return final weighted score
    pass

# Test with sample data
sample_dest = destinations[0]
sample_period = holiday_periods[0]
sample_climate = [c for c in climate_data if c["destination_id"] == sample_dest["id"]]

score = calculate_scores(sample_dest, sample_period, sample_climate)
print(f"Calculated Score: {score}")
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Create Project Structure**

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ross-family-holiday-planner
cd ross-family-holiday-planner

# Install dependencies based on consensus decisions
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npm install lucide-react  # icons
npm install @tanstack/react-query  # data fetching
```

**Step 2: Database Setup (Use Research Findings)**

Based on consensus, provide:
1. Database schema SQL
2. Seed data scripts
3. Database trigger for auto-calculating scores
4. Connection setup code

**Step 3: Core Components (Provide Scaffolding)**

Generate starter code for:
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with nav and footer

- `/lib/queries.ts` - Database query functions

**Step 4: Styling System**

Based on consensus, provide:
- Tailwind configuration with custom colors
- Dark mode setup
- Typography scale
- Component variants

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing (Use Code Execution)

**Test 1: Scoring Algorithm Accuracy**
```python
# Validate scoring produces reasonable results
# Test edge cases (extreme weather, very long flights)
# Ensure scores fall in 0-100 range
```

**Test 2: Filter Performance**
```python
# Benchmark filtering with 112 destinations
# Test debouncing effectiveness
# Validate filter combinations
```

**Test 3: Data Integrity**
```python
# Verify all destinations have 12 climate records
# Check foreign key relationships
# Validate score calculations
```
