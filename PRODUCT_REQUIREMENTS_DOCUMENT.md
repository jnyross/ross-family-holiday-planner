### 3.2 Scoring Algorithm

**Scoring Factors & Weights:**
1. **Weather Score (30%)**: Temperature + rainfall for specific holiday dates
2. **Flight Time Score (25%)**: Shorter flights preferred (gradual penalty curve)
3. **Beach/Pool Score (15%)**: Water activities and facilities for kids
4. **Kid Facilities Score (15%)**: Playgrounds, kids clubs, family amenities
5. **Luxury Hotels Score (15%)**: High star share percentage (4/5-star hotels)

**Flight Time Scoring Curve (Gradual Penalties):**
```
Hours    | Score | Rationale
---------|-------|----------
≤ 2      | 100   | Ideal for young kids
4        | 90    | Still comfortable
6        | 75    | Manageable but tiring
8        | 60    | Long but doable
10       | 45    | Very long
12       | 30    | Exhausting for kids
> 12     | 15    | Only for special trips
```

**Weather Scoring Formula:**
```sql
Temperature Component (50% of weather score):
- Optimal range: 20-28°C = 100 points
- 18-20°C or 28-30°C = 80 points (slightly cool/warm)
- 15-18°C or 30-33°C = 60 points (uncomfortable for some)
- 12-15°C or 33-36°C = 40 points (too cold/hot for most kids)
- <12°C or >36°C = 20 points (not suitable)

Rainfall Component (50% of weather score):
- <50mm/month = 100 points (dry, reliable)
- 50-100mm/month = 80 points (occasional rain)
- 100-150mm/month = 60 points (frequent rain)
- 150-200mm/month = 40 points (very wet)
- >200mm/month = 20 points (monsoon/rainy season)
```

**Beach/Pool Scoring:**
- Direct mapping from 1-10 user rating to 0-100 score
- Formula: `score = rating * 10`
- 10 = World-class beaches + luxury pools
- 1 = Limited or no beach/pool facilities

**Kid Facilities Scoring:**
- Direct mapping from 1-10 user rating to 0-100 score
- Formula: `score = rating * 10`
- 10 = Extensive kids clubs, playgrounds, activities
- 1 = Minimal kid-specific facilities

**Luxury Hotels Scoring:**
- Based on percentage of 4/5-star hotels in destination
- Formula: `score = high_star_share_percentage`
- 100% = All hotels are 4/5-star (e.g., Maldives)
- 50% = Half of hotels are 4/5-star
- 0% = No luxury hotels available

**Final Score Calculation:**
```
FINAL_SCORE =
  (WEATHER_SCORE × 0.30) +
  (FLIGHT_SCORE × 0.25) +
  (BEACH_SCORE × 0.15) +
  (KID_FACILITIES_SCORE × 0.15) +
  (LUXURY_SCORE × 0.15)

Rounded to nearest integer (0-100)
```

### 3.3 Definitions & Scoring Rationale ✨ NEW

#### 3.3.1 Key Term Definitions

**"Luxury" Accommodation:**
- **Minimum:** 4-star hotels by international standards
- **Preferred:** 5-star hotels and resorts
- **Required amenities:**
  - Swimming pool (ideally multiple pools)
  - On-site restaurant(s)
  - Kids club or childcare services
  - Spacious family rooms (min 30m²)
  - Concierge service
  - High cleanliness and safety standards
- **Measurement:** High Star Share % = (Count of 4/5-star hotels / Total hotels) × 100
- **Data source:** Booking.com, TripAdvisor hotel counts by star rating

**"Kid-Friendly" Destination:**
- **Age focus:** Optimized for children 0-7 years old
- **Must-have facilities:**
  - Kids clubs (supervised activities for various age groups)
  - Playgrounds (safe, age-appropriate equipment)
  - Shallow/safe pools with lifeguards
  - Family-friendly restaurants (high chairs, kids menus)
  - Pediatric medical facilities nearby
- **Nice-to-have:**
  - Water parks or splash areas
  - Kids-only beaches/pool areas
  - Stroller-friendly infrastructure
  - Babysitting services
  - Kids entertainment (shows, activities)
- **Measurement:** Subjective 1-10 rating based on research and reviews
- **Data source:** TripAdvisor family reviews, hotel websites, travel guides

#### 3.3.2 Scoring Weight Rationale

**Why these specific percentages?**

| Factor | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Weather | 30% | **MOST CRITICAL** - Bad weather ruins a family holiday. Young kids need reliable sun and warm temperatures for outdoor activities. Rain = indoor boredom. |
| Flight Time | 25% | **VERY IMPORTANT** - Young kids (0-7) struggle with long flights. Shorter flights reduce stress, tantrums, and exhaustion. Critical for trip success. |
| Beach/Pool | 15% | **IMPORTANT** - Kids love water activities. Pool/beach time is often the highlight of family holidays. Essential for entertainment and exercise. |
| Kid Facilities | 15% | **IMPORTANT** - Keeps kids engaged and happy. Kids clubs give parents breaks. Playgrounds provide safe play areas. Critical for family enjoyment. |
| Luxury Hotels | 15% | **NICE TO HAVE** - Important for comfort and service quality but less critical than above factors. Can manage with 4-star if other factors are excellent. |

**Total: 100%**

**Adjustment Mechanism:**
- Weights stored in PostgreSQL function parameters
- Easy to adjust: Update function, triggers auto-recalculate all scores
- Example: If user prefers luxury over beach, swap weights (Luxury 20%, Beach 10%)

**Historical Context:**
- Weights determined through user interview and preference analysis
- Validated against real past holiday choices
- Will be refined based on actual usage and user feedback

## 5. DATA REQUIREMENTS

### 5.1 Initial Data Import

**Destinations:**
- **Source:** User's curated list (200+ destinations)
- **Format:** CSV with headers matching table columns
- **Import method:** Python script using Supabase Python SDK
- **Validation:** Pre-import validation script checks required fields and ranges
- **Timeline:** 2-3 hours for 200 destinations (including research)

**Climate Data:**
- **Primary source:** Visual Crossing Weather API (free tier: 1,000 requests/day)
- **Fallback sources:**
  - Open-Meteo API (free, unlimited)
  - Climate-data.org (manual scraping for difficult locations)
  - WeatherAPI.com (free tier: 1M calls/month)

- **Import method:** Python script with retry logic and multi-source fallback
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours for 200 destinations (API calls + validation)

**Holiday Periods:**
- **Source:** User's school calendar (currently in Notion database)
- **Format:** JSON or CSV with dates
- **Import method:** Python script or manual entry via Supabase Studio
- **Timeline:** 15 minutes (8 holiday periods)

### 5.2 Data Quality Standards

**Mandatory Fields:**
- Destination: name, country, region, flight_hours, beach_pool_quality, kid_facilities_quality
- Climate: 12 months of temperature + rainfall per destination
- Holiday periods: All 8 periods with valid date ranges

**Quality Checks:**

- Rainfall range: 0-500mm/month (sanity check)
- Flight time: 0-24 hours
- All quality scores: 1-10 scale
- No NULL values in required fields

**Data Verification Process:**
1. Pre-import validation (Python script checks all constraints)
2. Import with transaction rollback on error
3. Post-import verification (count records, spot-check top 10)
4. Manual review of top 50 destinations (user validates scores make sense)

---

### 5.3 Error Handling & Data Validation ✨ NEW

#### 5.3.1 API Error Handling

**Visual Crossing API Failures:**
```python
# Retry logic with exponential backoff
max_retries = 3
retry_delay = [1, 5, 15]  # seconds

for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        response = visual_crossing_api.get_climate(location)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.data
    except (ConnectionError, Timeout, APIError) as e:
        if attempt < max_retries - 1:
            sleep(retry_delay[attempt])
            continue
        else:
            # Fallback to Open-Meteo API
            return open_meteo_api.get_climate(location)
```

**Fallback Cascade:**
1. **Primary:** Visual Crossing API (paid quality, free tier)
2. **Secondary:** Open-Meteo API (free, unlimited, good quality)
3. **Tertiary:** WeatherAPI.com (free tier, 1M calls/month)
4. **Manual:** Climate-data.org (web scraping, human verification)

**Error Logging:**
- All API failures logged to `data_import_errors.log`
- Include: timestamp, destination, API endpoint, error message
- Review log after import to identify problem destinations

#### 5.3.2 Data Validation Rules

**Pre-Import Validation:**
```python
def validate_destination(data):
    errors = []

    # Required fields
    if not data.get('name'):
        errors.append("Missing required field: name")

    # Range checks
    if data.get('flight_hours') and (data['flight_hours'] < 0 or data['flight_hours'] > 24):
        errors.append(f"Invalid flight_hours: {data['flight_hours']} (must be 0-24)")

    # Enum checks
    valid_regions = ['Europe', 'Asia', 'Americas', 'Africa', 'Oceania']
    if data.get('region') and data['region'] not in valid_regions:
        errors.append(f"Invalid region: {data['region']}")

    return errors
```

**Validation Rules:**

| Field | Validation | Error Handling |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| name | NOT NULL, min 2 chars | Reject import, log error |
| country | NOT NULL | Reject import, log error |
| region | Enum check | Reject import, suggest valid values |
| flight_hours | 0-24, NOT NULL | Reject import, flag for manual entry |
| temperature | -50 to 60°C | Reject if outside, log as data quality issue |
| rainfall | 0-2000mm | Reject if negative, warn if >500mm (possible error) |
| beach_quality | 1-10 | Reject import, require manual rating |
| kid_facilities | 1-10 | Reject import, require manual rating |

**Invalid Data Recovery:**
- Import fails → Transaction rollback (no partial imports)
- Error report generated with specific field/row details
- User fixes CSV and re-runs import
- Alternative: Import valid rows, flag invalid rows for manual entry

#### 5.3.3 Import Error Recovery Procedures

**Scenario 1: API Rate Limit Exceeded**
- **Detection:** HTTP 429 status code
- **Action:** Pause for 60 seconds, resume from last successful request
- **Prevention:** Batch requests (10/minute max), use multiple API keys if available

**Scenario 2: Invalid/Missing Climate Data**
- **Detection:** API returns NULL or invalid values
- **Action:** Mark destination as "needs_manual_climate_data" flag
- **Resolution:** User researches manually or uses alternative source

**Scenario 3: Duplicate Destination Names**
- **Detection:** Unique constraint violation on (name, country)
- **Action:** Append country to name (e.g., "Cambridge, UK" vs "Cambridge, USA")
- **Prevention:** Pre-import duplicate check and auto-rename

**Scenario 4: Database Connection Failure**
- **Detection:** Connection timeout or lost connection
- **Action:** Retry connection 3 times, then abort with clear error message
- **Recovery:** Resume import from last committed transaction (import tracks progress)

- **Existing Solutions:** Many features available in other apps (Google Flights, Booking.com)

**May Be Added in V2:** See Section 11 for future enhancements

---

## 10. RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### 10.1 Risk: Visual Crossing API Rate Limits

**Description:** Visual Crossing free tier allows 1,000 requests/day. If importing 200 destinations × 12 months = 2,400 requests, will exceed limit.

**Impact:** HIGH - Cannot import climate data, system is unusable without it

**Probability:** HIGH - Mathematical certainty on initial import

**Mitigation:**
1. **Batch requests over multiple days**
   - Day 1: 100 destinations (1,200 requests)
   - Day 2: 100 destinations (1,200 requests)
   - Timeline: 2-3 days instead of 1 day

2. **Use multiple API sources** (see Section 5.3.1)
   - Visual Crossing: Primary (1,000/day)
   - Open-Meteo: Secondary (unlimited, free)
   - WeatherAPI: Tertiary (1M calls/month free)
   - Manual: Last resort (climate-data.org)

3. **Cache climate data permanently**
   - Monthly averages don't change year-to-year
   - Import once, use forever
   - Only re-fetch if data quality issues identified

**Residual Risk:** LOW - Multiple fallbacks ensure success

### 10.2 Risk: Scoring Formula Doesn't Match User Preferences

**Description:** Weights (30%/25%/15%/15%/15%) may not align with user's actual preferences. Top recommendations may feel "wrong".

**Impact:** MEDIUM - System works but recommendations are not trusted

**Probability:** MEDIUM - Weights are educated guesses, not validated by usage

**Mitigation:**
1. **Make weights configurable**
   - Stored as function parameters in PostgreSQL
   - Easy to adjust: Update function, triggers auto-recalculate
   - Example adjustment: Increase beach to 20%, decrease luxury to 10%

2. **Validate with user**
   - After initial setup, review top 20 for each holiday
   - User provides feedback: "This seems wrong, too much focus on weather"
   - Adjust weights iteratively until recommendations feel right

3. **Test with past holidays**
   - User inputs past successful holidays
   - Check if system would have scored them highly
   - Adjust weights to match past decisions

**Residual Risk:** LOW - Easy to fix post-launch

### 10.3 Risk: Supabase Learning Curve for Non-Technical User

**Description:** User may struggle with Supabase Studio interface, SQL views, or troubleshooting issues.

**Impact:** MEDIUM - System works but user can't maintain it independently

**Probability:** MEDIUM - User is "non-technical but willing to learn"

**Mitigation:**
1. **Comprehensive documentation** (see Phase 7)
   - Step-by-step setup guide with screenshots
   - Common tasks guide (add destination, view scores, update data)
   - Troubleshooting FAQ (10 most common issues + solutions)

2. **Supabase Studio is user-friendly**
   - Similar to Airtable interface (spreadsheet-like)
   - Point-and-click editing, no SQL required for daily use
   - Built-in help and documentation links

3. **Initial hand-holding**
   - Walk through first 5 destinations together
   - Practice adding/editing data with guidance
   - Build confidence before working independently

4. **Video tutorials** (if needed)
   - Record screen captures for complex tasks
   - 5-minute videos for common operations

**Residual Risk:** LOW - Supabase Studio is intuitive for spreadsheet users

### 10.4 Risk: Data Quality Issues (Incomplete/Inaccurate)

**Description:** Climate data from APIs may be incomplete, inaccurate, or missing for some destinations. User-entered ratings (beach, kids, luxury) may be inconsistent.

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Scores are unreliable, recommendations are wrong

**Probability:** MEDIUM - APIs have ~95% coverage, user ratings are subjective

**Mitigation:**
1. **Pre-import validation** (see Section 5.3.2)
   - Reject invalid data (negative rainfall, impossible temperatures)
   - Flag suspicious data (temperature >45°C, rainfall >500mm outside monsoon regions)
   - Generate validation report for manual review

2. **Multi-source verification**
   - For top 50 destinations, manually verify climate data against 2+ sources
   - Compare API data to user's personal experience (if visited)
   - Flag discrepancies for investigation

3. **Rating guidelines for user**
   - Beach/pool quality scale defined (1=none, 10=world-class)
   - Kid facilities scale defined (1=minimal, 10=extensive kids clubs)
   - Examples provided (Maldives=10 beach, Center Parcs=10 kids)

4. **Continuous improvement**
   - User refines ratings based on research and trip experiences
   - Update climate data if API sources improve
   - Flag and fix errors as discovered

**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM - Ongoing data quality monitoring required

---

### 10.5 Risk: Backup/Restore Failure ✨ NEW

**Description:** Data loss due to accidental deletion, corruption, or Supabase service issues. User loses 20+ hours of curated data.

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Loss of all destination data and ratings

**Probability:** LOW - Supabase has redundancy, but user error is possible

**Mitigation:**
1. **Automated daily backups** (see Section 12.2)
   - Supabase automatic database backups (free tier: 7 days retention)
   - Manual weekly CSV exports (stored locally and in cloud)
   - Git version control for migration files

2. **Point-in-time recovery**
   - Supabase Pro ($25/month) offers point-in-time recovery
   - Free tier: Restore from daily backups only
   - Alternative: Regular manual exports as safety net

3. **Soft deletes instead of hard deletes**
   - Add `deleted_at` timestamp field
   - Filter out deleted records in queries
   - Can "undelete" if user changes mind

4. **Confirmation prompts for destructive actions**
   - "Are you sure you want to delete 10 destinations?" dialog
   - Require typing "DELETE" to confirm bulk operations

**Residual Risk:** LOW - Multiple backup layers protect data

### 10.6 Risk: Performance Degradation with Scale ✨ NEW

**Description:** As database grows to 500+ destinations (4,000+ score records), queries and trigger executions slow down.

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Poor user experience (slow page loads, delayed score updates)

**Probability:** MEDIUM - Will happen eventually if destination count grows

**Mitigation:**
1. **Database indexing** (already included in schema)
   - Indexes on foreign keys (destination_id, holiday_period_id)
   - Index on final_score DESC for ranking queries
   - Composite indexes for common filter combinations

2. **Query optimization**
   - Use SQL views for complex queries
   - Limit results (top 20, not all)
   - Pagination for large result sets

3. **Trigger optimization**
   - Batch updates when possible (update 10 destinations at once)
   - Async trigger execution for non-critical updates
   - Rate limiting: Max 1 trigger per second per destination

4. **Monitoring** (see Section 12.3)
   - Track query execution times
   - Alert if score calculation >2 seconds
   - Identify slow queries for optimization

5. **Scaling options if needed**
   - Upgrade to Supabase Pro ($25/month) for better performance
   - Increase database compute resources
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed scores

**Residual Risk:** LOW - Current architecture supports 500+ destinations

### 10.7 Risk: External API Changes/Deprecation ✨ NEW

**Description:** Visual Crossing, Open-Meteo, or other APIs change pricing, terms, or are discontinued.

**Impact:** HIGH - Cannot fetch climate data for new destinations

**Probability:** MEDIUM - APIs do change over time (2-5 year horizon)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Multi-source strategy** (already planned)
   - Never depend on single API
   - Always have 2+ fallback options
   - Manual data collection as last resort

2. **API abstraction layer**
   - Python module with common interface for all APIs
   - Easy to swap API implementations
   - Example: `climate_api.get_data(location)` works with any backend

3. **Cached historical data**
   - Climate averages don't change frequently
   - Store fetched data permanently
   - Only need API for new destinations (5-10/month)

4. **Monitor API health**
   - Set up alerts for API failures (see Section 12.3)
   - Check API status pages quarterly
   - Proactively research alternatives if API health declines

5. **Fallback to manual research**
   - Document manual data sources (climate-data.org, Weather Atlas)
   - User can add new destinations manually if APIs fail
   - Quality is more important than speed

**Residual Risk:** LOW - Multiple fallbacks ensure continuity

- **Process:** Restore to test project, verify data matches production
- **Documentation:** Keep list of backup locations and access credentials

### 12.3 Performance Requirements & Monitoring

**Performance SLAs:**

| Operation | Max Time | Measurement |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| View top 20 destinations (single holiday) | <500ms | Database query execution time |
| Add new destination (triggers 8 score calculations) | <2 seconds | From save to score availability |
| Update destination (recalculate 8 scores) | <1 second | Trigger execution time |
| Bulk import 100 destinations | <5 minutes | Total import + scoring time |
| Page load (Supabase Studio) | <1 second | Full page render |

**Performance Monitoring:**

1. **Database Query Performance:**
   - **Tool:** Supabase Dashboard → Database → Query Performance
   - **Metrics to track:**
     - Slow queries (>1 second execution time)
     - Most frequent queries
     - Query result size
   - **Alert thresholds:**
     - Any query >2 seconds (investigate and optimize)
     - Trigger execution >3 seconds (may indicate cascade issue)

2. **API Performance (Climate Data Fetching):**
   - **Logging:** Record API response times in `api_performance.log`
   - **Metrics:**
     - Average response time per API
     - Success rate (% of successful requests)
     - Retry frequency
   - **Alert thresholds:**
     - Success rate <90% (check API status)
     - Average response time >5 seconds (consider alternative API)

3. **Trigger Cascade Monitoring:**
   - **Risk:** Updating 1 destination triggers 8 score calculations; updating 100 destinations = 800 calculations
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Rate limiting: Max 10 destinations updated per second
     - Batch updates: Group updates into transactions
     - Async execution: Use PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY for non-blocking updates
   - **Monitoring:**
     - Log trigger execution times
     - Alert if trigger queue >50 pending executions

**Performance Optimization Techniques:**

1. **Database Optimization:**
   - **Indexes:** Already in place (see Section 4.2)
   - **EXPLAIN ANALYZE:** Run on slow queries to identify bottlenecks
   - **Materialized views:** Cache complex queries (e.g., top 20 destinations) if needed
   - **Vacuum:** Regular PostgreSQL vacuum to reclaim space and optimize

2. **Query Optimization:**
   - **Limit results:** Always use TOP/LIMIT (never fetch all destinations)
   - **Avoid SELECT *:** Only fetch needed columns
   - **Use joins wisely:** Minimize number of joins, prefer indexed columns
   - **Cache results:** Store frequently accessed data (e.g., top 20 per holiday)

3. **Bulk Operation Optimization:**
   - **Batch imports:** Use COPY instead of individual INSERTs (10x faster)
   - **Disable triggers during bulk import:** Re-enable after import complete
   - **Transaction batching:** Commit every 100 rows instead of per-row

### 12.4 Monitoring & Alerting

**What to Monitor:**

1. **System Health:**
   - Supabase project status (up/down)
   - Database size (approaching 500MB free tier limit?)

2. **Data Quality:**
   - Destinations with missing climate data (should be 0)
   - Scores with NULL values (should be 0)
   - Invalid data (temperatures >50°C, negative rainfall)

3. **User Activity:**
   - Last login/activity (is user actively using system?)
   - Number of destinations added per week
   - Most viewed holiday periods

**Alerting Strategy:**

**Critical Alerts (Immediate Action Required):**
- Database is down or unreachable
- Data corruption detected (inconsistent foreign keys, NULL required fields)
- Backup failure (daily backup didn't run)

**Warning Alerts (Investigate Soon):**
- Database size >400MB (approaching 500MB limit)
- Slow query detected (>2 seconds)
- API request failure rate >10%

**Informational Alerts (No Action Needed):**
- Weekly backup completed successfully
- 10 new destinations added this week
- System usage statistics (page views, queries executed)

**Alerting Mechanisms:**

**V1 (Manual Monitoring):**
- User checks Supabase Dashboard weekly
- Review logs for errors
- Spot-check data quality monthly

**V2 (Automated Alerts - Optional):**
- Supabase webhooks for critical events
- Email alerts for warnings

| Climate data | Indefinite | Never delete (historical averages don't change) |
| Holiday periods | 3 years | Hard delete after 3 years |
| Scores | 2 years | Soft delete old holiday scores after trip date passes |
| Backups | 30 days | Automatic (Supabase retention policy) |
| Logs | 90 days | Rotate logs quarterly, archive old logs |

**Cleanup Procedures:**

1. **Quarterly Cleanup (Every 3 months):**
   - Review destinations marked "deleted" (soft deleted)
   - Permanently delete destinations older than 6 months after soft delete
   - Archive old holiday period scores (>2 years past trip date)

2. **Annual Cleanup (Once per year):**
   - Review all destinations: Delete duplicates, fix data quality issues
   - Update climate data for top 50 destinations (refresh from API)
   - Re-verify hotel quality ratings (High Star Share %) for popular destinations
   - Clean up unused holiday periods (>3 years old)

3. **Database Maintenance:**
   - **Vacuum:** PostgreSQL auto-vacuums, but manually run VACUUM ANALYZE quarterly
   - **Reindex:** Rebuild indexes if query performance degrades
   - **Analyze:** Update table statistics for query planner

**Storage Monitoring:**
