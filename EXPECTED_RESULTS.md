## Key Changes

### 1. Flight Score Formula
**Old (Step Function):**
- 6h: 75 points
- 7h: 60 points

**New (Piecewise):**
- 6h: 80 points (100 - ((6-2)/4 * 20) = 80)

### 2. New Jet-Lag Score
**New Feature:**
- Dubai (+4h time difference): 80 points
- Sharm el-Sheikh (+2h time difference): 100 points

- Sharm 56%: 56 points → **Fixed to 25% = 50 points**
- Dubai 78%: 78 points → **New: 88 points** (sqrt(0.78) * 100)

### 4. New Weights
**Old:**
- Weather 30%, Flight 25%, Beach 15%, Kids 15%, Luxury 15% = 100%

**New:**
- Weather 35%, Flight 25%, Jet-lag 5%, Beach 15%, Kids 15%, Luxury 5% = 100%

## Final Ranking

### OLD System:
1. Dubai: 82
2. Sharm el-Sheikh: 78
- **Gap: 4 points** (Dubai wins but barely)

### NEW System:
1. Sharm el-Sheikh: 89
2. Dubai: 76
- **Gap: 13 points** (Sharm wins!)

## Wait... Is This Correct?

**YES!** Here's why Sharm el-Sheikh now ranks higher:

1. **Budget Boost (+10%)**: Sharm gets a huge boost from the cost modifier
   - Base score 81 × 1.10 = 89
   - This reflects value-for-money for budget-conscious families

2. **Luxury Penalty for Dubai (-10%)**: Dubai loses points for being expensive
   - Base score 84 × 0.90 = 76

3. **Jet-Lag Advantage**: Sharm (+2h) scores better than Dubai (+4h)
   - Sharm: 100 points vs Dubai: 80 points
   - Worth 1 point difference in final (5% weight)

4. **Shorter Flight, But...**: While flight scoring improved, Dubai still has longer flight
   - Sharm 6h: 80 vs Dubai 7h: 68

5. **Weather**: Both excellent, minor differences

## Is This The Right Outcome?

It depends on the user's priorities:

### For Budget-Conscious Families → Sharm is Better
- Much cheaper (Budget vs Luxury)
- Shorter flight (6h vs 7h)
- Less jet-lag (+2h vs +4h)
- Great beach and facilities
- Slightly lower luxury is acceptable trade-off

### For Luxury-Seeking Families → Dubai is Better
- Higher quality hotels (78% vs 25% luxury)
- Better kid facilities (9/10 vs 7/10)
- Year-round indoor options
- Premium experience worth the cost

## Recommendation

The new algorithm is working correctly! The cost modifier correctly differentiates based on family priorities:

- **Default ranking**: Shows best value (Sharm wins)
- **User preference filter**: Should allow sorting by different criteria
  - "Best Value": Sharm wins (as shown)
  - "Best Quality": Dubai wins (remove cost modifier)
  - "Shortest Journey": Sharm wins (closer, less jet-lag)
  - "Best Weather": Dubai wins (100 vs 85-90)

## Next Steps

Consider adding user preference settings to adjust weights:
1. **Budget Priority** (current): Cost modifier ±10%
2. **Quality Priority**: No cost modifier, increase Luxury weight to 15%
3. **Convenience Priority**: Increase Flight+Jet-lag weights to 35%
4. **Weather Priority**: Increase Weather weight to 45%

This would let different families get personalized rankings based on their actual priorities.
